A dress, suit, or jumpsuit—in lighter colors (avoiding cream and white) and breathable fabrics—are all acceptable for women to wear. If you choose to wear a beachy dress, specifically, consider a tea-length or maxi look to avoid looking too casual. Dressy sandals, chunky heels, and wedges are acceptable footwear options. For men, dress pants/slacks, button down shirts, optional tie and suit jacket is a nice touch. Avoid: tshirts, jeans, too casual pants, casual sundresses."
